It helped me immensely to have someone who helped guide me through the storm, so here I will do my best to give some tips and tricks on the classes you will take as well as recommendations and warnings for electives later on for your last 3 semesters.</p> <blockquote> <p><img class="emoji" title=":memo:" alt=":memo:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" height="20" width="20"> <strong>Note:</strong> These are just my opinions based off my experience, please do not take this as gospel.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><img class="emoji" title=":question:" alt=":question:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2753.png" height="20" width="20"> <strong>Question not answered here?</strong> Feel free to email me at colehfeely@gmail.com</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2> <ul> <li><a href="#preface-points">Preface Points</a></li> <li><a href="#before-freshman-year">Before Freshman Year</a></li> <li><a href="#curriculum">Curriculum</a></li> <li><a href="#freshman-year">Freshman Year</a></li> <li><a href="#sophomore-year">Sophomore Year</a></li> <li><a href="#junior-year">Junior Year</a></li> <li><a href="#design-projects">Design Projects</a></li> <li><a href="#electives">Electives</a></li> </ul> <h1 id="preface-points">Preface Points</h1> <p>Some things I think you should definitely know early on in your journey.</p> <ol> <li>Don’t Double Major in CS and CompE <ul> <li>That’s completely BS, no company is really going to care and you’re just going to be dying for 5 years instead of 4</li> </ul> </li> <li>If you have any interest in business, you MUST take the Engineering Management Minor <ul> <li>Isenberg classes are very very restrictive and it’s a great opportunity to take classes outside of ECE and great if you are interesting in combining Tech and Business</li> <li>Isenberg classes are very easy and can help your GPA</li> <li>Downside is 5 extra classes through an already packed schedule</li> <li>I only recommend if you are coming into College with 2+ Gen Eds from College credit or consider taking some Gen Eds at a community college over the summer</li> </ul> </li> <li>If you get into the Honors College, keep it for the first two years for the housing (worth it) but consider not doing take any honors classes or do the thesis senior year <ul> <li>I know you have a high ego and you want to have that one part of your resume to show off to others but I promise your sanity is not worth it, most Honors Computer Engineers drop it</li> <li>The Classes are insanely harder than the general classes for no extra credit whatsoever and will only hurt your GPA</li> <li>You will already have your Senior Design Project Senior year and doing an honors thesis is too much work. Doing grunt work for a professor’s lab will not be fun combined with the amount of work SDP will be</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Although, I have heard they removed the honors thesis requirement for ECE honors students - Companies could not give two shits whether you are in an honors college or not. If anything, they would care about your GPA more (remember the harder classes?), and they don’t really care about that to begin with. They care more about how good you can code/ your knowledge about EE or Comp E and what projects you have completed</li> </ul> </li> <li>You are not an Engineering Major, you are an ECE major. After Freshman year, you have nothing in common with the other engineering majors. They basically become either applied Physics or Chemistry majors. Don’t do too much work with people outside of ECE because very soon, you will not be in class with them and other people will group up without you</li> </ol> <h1 id="before-freshman-year">Before Freshman Year</h1> <p>Yes I know, before your Freshman Year, you shouldn’t worry about school and you should focus on spending the rest of your time at home with your friends and having little responsibility or expectations. But there are definitely some things you need to know before heading into the course.</p> <ol> <li>Know what classes you can get credit for from High School <ul> <li>This is crucial because in ECE, you have a very busy first 3 years and taking a Gen Ed is a big time sink, getting a lot of those out of the way early on is crucial</li> </ul> </li> <li>Your first year to year and a half, you will take a lot of general STEM classes <ul> <li>These are to give you the background knowledge/ understanding for your higher level classes later on</li> <li>As a warning, these are weed out classes- in fact, the first two years are weed out classes</li> <li>Physics and Calculus are challenging for many people and forces many of them out of the major</li> </ul> </li> <li>BEFORE YOU GO TO YOUR ORIENTATION <ul> <li>You will refer to the <a href="#curriculum">curriculum chart</a> below and do the following:</li> <li>Go to your <a href="https://www.spire.umass.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Spire</a> and click on courses</li> <li>Go to course search</li> <li>Look up your courses (Math 131, Physics 151, English Writing)</li> <li>Look up the professors on rate my professor and write these down</li> <li>Note the ones that are too early or too late</li> <li>When you go to Orientation, they will have you pick your classes. These people do not care about you and will make you have the worst schedule ever. But if you take these steps, you will know which classes to take so you aren’t dying in November</li> </ul> </li> <li>Each ECE class has prerequesites <ul> <li>Why is this important? If you’re looking to graduate early or study abroad, you will need to look into which courses require other classes to rearrange your schedule</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consider how important studying abroad is <ul> <li>If it’s a top priority of yours, talk to Bill Leonard(a super helpful and nice Professor) right away to see how this is possible</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consider taking a minor <ul> <li>This is only feasible if you come into school with credits from high school courses</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h1 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h1> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/ece-curriculum.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="curriculum" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Above outlines which classes you will take through your time with the major. As you can see, in Comp E, the first year is a lot of general classes, but then your second year, you start taking all ECE classes. ECE is the only engineering major that starts taking pure Engineering classes this early, other engineering majors continue to take more math and science classes until junior year. You can start picking your classes Junior Year second semester, but until then, you only get to pick your Gen Ed classes.</p> <p> </p> <hr> <h1 id="computer-freshman-year"> <img class="emoji" title=":computer:" alt=":computer:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" height="20" width="20"> Freshman Year</h1> <p> </p> <h2 id="fall-semester-1">Fall (Semester 1)</h2> <h4 id="engineering-112">Engineering 112</h4> <ul> <li>An introduction to ECE where professors try to show you the different things you can do in the field</li> <li>Professors in the class: <ul> <li>Professor Wolf is amazing</li> <li>Hollot is okay but up tight</li> <li>Sequira is very weird</li> </ul> </li> <li>The homeworks will be hard on purpose and really long, I suggest going to TA office hours and finding other kids to collaborate with</li> <li>There are some specific questions mixed with conceptual homework type questions on the exams  </li> </ul> <h4 id="physics-151">Physics 151</h4> <ul> <li>This is a huge weed out class</li> <li>Kids from all sorts of majors are here and its going to be a challenge to complete</li> <li>The homeworks are all online and there are two three exams.
