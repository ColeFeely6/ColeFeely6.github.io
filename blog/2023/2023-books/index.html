The book was super short so I gave it a go. I appreciated how this book jumped right into it and didn’t spend chapters upon chapters world building like so many other books of the genre do. The author puts you right into the mind of murderbot and you really get to know the character and become attached with his relatability. The technology and action in this book was really cool, it painted a picture in my mind. The main issue I had was the plot was very unoriginal and the author kept leading on a twist that was anticlimactic. Overall, the character and world building showed great potential and the rest of the series shows great promise as I assume this popular author’s plot building becomes better through the series.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <p> </p> <h3 id="the-thursday-murder-club">The Thursday Murder Club</h3> <p> </p> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/tmc1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="tmc" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <ul> <li>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li> <li>Feb 2023</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Absolutely loved this book! I would put this book as the best so far, but I’m reading the sequel and it’s even better. Osman does an incredible job building hilarious and charming characters who constantly come out with witty jokes that embody the British and Irish humor. Osman does an excellent job writing from the perspective of older people and I feel like I have grown a better appreciate for elderly folks- he really makes them out to be their own unique people with aspirations and deep feelings. The TMC is essentially about a group of retirees in England who form a club to solve mysteries and befriend the town’s police officers to help them solve a town murder. My only gripe with this novel was the plot was a little dry, but the character building and the humor kept me glued to the page. This being Osman’s first book, I’m very excited for what else he has in store!</p> </blockquote> <p>  <strong>__</strong><strong>__</strong>_____  </p> <h3 id="the-man-who-died-twice">The Man who died Twice</h3> <p> </p> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/tmwd2.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="tmwd2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <ul> <li>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li> <li>Feb 2023</li> <li>💫 Best Book so Far</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>What a delivery from the first book!

In a genre where many of these type of science-based self-help books are hard to read because of academic writing, this book uses language that is not only easy to understand but enjoyable, which I believe was the purpose. The authors, major researchers in the field of ADHD, were the first people to coin the term ADD and have made many strides in their field to help ADHD be understood as it is by the general population today. They have written eevrything out in a way where they show that ADHD is not something bad, but that the brain works in a different way and gives tips on how to work with your or your child’s ADHD. They also discuss VAST, ADHD symptoms that are induced by today’s dopamine seeking world. Overall, very helpful book and I have found some methods to help with understanding the way my brain is wired.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <p> </p> <h1 id="books-graphic-novels"> <img class="emoji" title=":books:" alt=":books:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4da.png" height="20" width="20"> Graphic Novels:</h1> <h3 id="invincible-vol-4">Invincible Vol. 4</h3> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/invincible.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="invincible 4" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <ul> <li>⭐⭐⭐</li> <li>Feb 2023</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>I was a little disapointed when reading this. I watched the first season of this show in 2021 and absolute LOVED it. The animation was amazing, the story was so well done out, it was perfect and it left me wanting more. So I’ve been wanting to read the series for a while now so when I found this in the library, I had to pick it up. It takes place right after the TV show which I appreciated but one of the first things I noticed is that the art style isn’t the same which is understandable. This comic has a more griddy style while the show’s art style is a bit softer and the colors jump out at you more. The story was entertaining and it kept me turning the page but it lacked any central plot- it sort of felt like a TV show on Nickelodeon where each episode is self-contained. One thing I did appreciate was that the show changed a lot of the character’s races and personalities which I appreciated, definitely made the show more diverse. This volume did a good job character building and developing relationships so I’m definitely going to continue with the series but I was definitely underwhelmed which is why is received a lower score.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h3 id="batman-vol-1-the-court-of-owls">Batman Vol. 1: The Court of Owls</h3> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/batman-coo-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Batman COO vol1" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <ul> <li>⭐⭐⭐⭐</li> <li>Mar 2023</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Now this was a great read for comic book fans. Although I knew the plot of this series already because if its popularity and its animated movie, I was still pleasantly surprised with how well the story was drawn out. Reading this really felt like a movie and really felt true to the character of Batman. The gritty art style wasn’t my favorite but is expected of Batman comics. There was a scene in this book when you had to interact with the book physically in such a way that described the declining sanity of one of the characters which really took me aback- such an amazing way to represent the state of mind of a character and to interact with a book. I thought some characters were drawn pretty bland, every character was basically white with black hair, wish there was more diversity because everyone looked the same and it was hard to tell certain characters apart. This doesn’t get a 5 star because I feel that a 5 star review would mean that I would really push a friend who doesn’t read comic books to read it, but this comic was still a page turner!</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h3 id="batman-vol-2-the-city-of-owls">Batman Vol. 2: The City of Owls</h3> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/batman-city-of-owls.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Batman COO vol2" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <ul> <li>⭐⭐⭐⭐</li> <li>Mar 2023</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>This improved so much on the first one. The art style in this one was way better (I actually took some pictures of some panes because some were so well done) and it actually addressed some of the issues that I had in the first one. This one was better than the first which was great but the villains get less scary because of the plot choice. Definitely see why this has been a popular Batman series. Only 4 stars because I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who doesn’t read comics.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h3 id="batman-vol-3-death-of-the-family">Batman Vol. 3: Death of the Family</h3> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/batman-dotf.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Batman dotf" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <ul> <li>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li> <li>Mar 2023</li> <li>💫 Best Graphic Novel so Far</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Now this is a comic book I would recommend to a non-comic reader. Holy cow, this book is terrifying. There is some scenes in this book where my jaw dropped, it was such so cinematic. If even some elements of this were adopted to a movie, the world would be shocked.
